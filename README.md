The PCB's are designed to get you started on your own robotic lawnmower project. 
It doesn't matter if you want to convert a commercial mower or use a 3D printed housing.

The TeensyMainPCB is the brain of the mower to which all sensors and motors are connected.
The PowerPCB is responsible for the power supply and monitoring of the battery and the motors. 
For your DIY project you need both boards.

Only a few Electronic Parts are needed. 
- JST-XH Connectors
- Screw Terminal 5.04mm
- Resistors
- Pin Header Connector 2.54mm
- Active Buzzer
- LED
- Jumper
- Teensy 4.1
