The PCB's are designed to get you started on your own robotic lawnmower project. 
It doesn't matter if you want to convert a commercial mower or use a 3D printed housing.

The TeensyMainPCB is the brain of the mower to which all sensors and motors are connected.
The PowerPCB is responsible for the power supply and monitoring of the battery and the motors. 
The Wifi SenderPCB is responsible for the perimeter cable and goes into the charging station of the mower.

For your DIY project you need all 3 Boards.
